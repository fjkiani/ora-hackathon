# AI-Powered Crypto Hedge Fund Platform

## üèÜ NYU Hackathon Winner

This project was the winning submission for the NYU Hackathon, showcasing an innovative integration of AI and blockchain technologies through the ORA Framework.

## üìù Project Overview

Our platform bridges the gap between traditional finance and decentralized finance (DeFi) by creating an intelligent system where AI agents can autonomously interact with blockchain networks to execute complex financial strategies. The application provides a comprehensive dashboard for monitoring DeFi protocols, assessing risks, and creating customized AI agents that can manage assets across multiple protocols.

## üîë Key Features

- **Interactive ORA Framework Visualization**: Step-by-step visualization of how AI agents interact with blockchain networks, complete with animations and simulated transactions
- **Risk Assessment Tools**: Comprehensive analysis of various risk factors in DeFi protocols
- **Protocol Monitoring Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring of key metrics for DeFi protocols
- **Agent Creation Interface**: User-friendly interface for creating and deploying AI agents with specific parameters
- **Transaction Logs**: Detailed logs of transactions executed by AI agents
- **Claude AI Assistant**: Integrated AI assistant to answer DeFi-related questions

## üõ†Ô∏è Our Approach

### Technical Architecture

1. **Frontend**: React-based dashboard with interactive visualizations and user interfaces
2. **AI Integration**: Claude API integration for the AI assistant and agent suggestion features
3. **Blockchain Connectivity**: ORA Framework integration for connecting AI agents to blockchain networks
4. **Data Visualization**: Chart.js for rendering financial data and protocol metrics
5. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface that works across devices

### Development Process

1. **Research Phase**: Studied the ORA Framework documentation and DeFi protocols to understand the integration points
2. **Design Phase**: Created wireframes and user flows for the dashboard and visualization components
3. **Implementation Phase**: Developed the frontend components, integrated the Claude API, and created the ORA Framework visualization
4. **Testing Phase**: Tested the application with various scenarios and refined the user experience
5. **Presentation Phase**: Prepared the demo and presentation for the hackathon judges

## üöÄ Problems Solved

Our solution addresses several critical challenges in the DeFi space:

1. **Technical Barrier**: Reduces the technical knowledge required to interact with DeFi protocols
2. **Risk Management**: Provides comprehensive risk assessment tools for evaluating DeFi investments
3. **Transparency**: Offers clear visualization of how AI agents operate on the blockchain
4. **Security**: Ensures secure, verifiable AI-driven transactions through the ORA Framework
5. **User Experience**: Creates an intuitive interface for managing complex DeFi operations


## üåê Future Enhancements

- Integration with additional DeFi protocols
- Enhanced AI agent capabilities for more complex strategies
- Mobile application development
- Real-time alerts and notifications
- Advanced portfolio analytics
